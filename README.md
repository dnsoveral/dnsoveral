# Hello there! 

I'm an ex Retail Manager with 13 years of experience in Food Production, Retail Management as well as Team Leading and Management, with a particular passion for Coaching People and Data Science, the Analytics part of the Management and the Science part of the Data, with predicting Patterns in and out of the usual and looking for Outliers in Data. 
As for a particular and personal interest and passion, I'm trying to work and learn more about Mental Health and Neurodivergencies. 
I'm constantly learning and looking to learn more and explore more about Data Science and Mental Health in particular right now, and Coaching and Retail Management as "business as usual". 
Although, there are particular areas of Data Science I'd like to learn and work more specifically as I said before, for me learning it as whole it's the best way to understand it. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on projects about Mental Health and and Neurodivergencies, like ADHD and Autism, or projects about Retail and Food Industry, in a way to learn more about Data Science, Programming and Neurodivergencies and Mental Health themselves.
- ðŸ‘¯ I'm looking to work in Retail in General, with the Food Industry and Retail, or learning something new. 
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on a personal level, maybe voluntary even, in projects about Neurodivergencies and Mental Health, particularly in Portugal, my country of residence.

My Projects on my BootCamp:

## Market Basket Analysis 

- I used a dataset from Kaggle from a French Bakery and analyzed and explored its Data to find patterns and create possible bundles to upscale sales in the bakery as well as to know the hours with the most sales. 

## Spotify Song Recomender 

- Used a 10MillionSongSubset to create a recommender based on a song chosen by the user, and using its features to look for the most similar songs, and give the user the most similar 5 songs for it to choose the one he wants.

## Ratatouille: Recipe Recommender

- This project started as one thing, and ended up being another as I started to practice and learn about more and more about algorithms of Machine Learning and Deep Learning to predict missing elements of the Recipes, as well as the web scraping of them. I produced several mistakes and tried to correct them. And ended up with a streamlit app that didn't work properly for some reason.
- Meanwhile I tried to recreate the project with more Data and I'll create a new repository for it, and identify them both as the final project, although the last one is still a work in progress.

I love to work and I'm planning to delve more in Relational Databases like MySQL and to develop my Dashboarding and Data Visualization skills. 

Feel free to contact me whenever you wish to ask me something!
